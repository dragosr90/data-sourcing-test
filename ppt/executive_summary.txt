Financial institutions face rising threats from fraud, money laundering, and social-engineering risks, while regulatory expectations for transparency and explainability continue to tighten. 
Traditional rule-based monitoring platforms generate high volumes of false positives, overwhelming analysts and slowing response times.

To address this, we propose a GenAI-powered anomaly detection platform on Azure that unifies real-time transaction monitoring, behavioral analysis, graph intelligence, and natural-language risk explanations. 
The solution continuously ingests financial and interaction data streams, applies advanced anomaly detection models, and leverages GenAI to generate clear, human-readable rationales for each alert.

Key features include:

Streaming anomaly detection with millisecond latency using Databricks, Event Hubs, and Azure ML.

Graph-based risk scoring to uncover hidden mule networks, collusion, and layered transactions.

GenAI co-pilot providing plain-language explanations, case summaries, and next-best investigative steps.

Continuous drift and bias monitoring, ensuring models remain accurate, fair, and regulator-ready.

Seamless governance with Azure Purview for data lineage, RBAC for access control, and Responsible AI guardrails.

This integrated framework transforms raw transaction and customer-interaction data into trusted, actionable intelligence. 
By reducing false positives, accelerating analyst workflows, and providing explainable insights, the platform enables banks to protect customer trust, strengthen compliance posture, and respond faster to emerging threats.
