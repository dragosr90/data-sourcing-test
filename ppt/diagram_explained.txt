1. Ingestion Layer

Where all the raw signals flow in.

Event Hubs â†’ Streams transactional events (payments, logins, account actions) in near-real-time.

API Management (APIM) â†’ Brings in digital interaction data: chat logs, helpdesk tickets, mobile app events, IVR transcripts. 
  This is crucial for detecting social engineering (fraudulent customer conversations, scam scripts, phishing attempts).

IoT Hub â†’ ATM & branch device telemetry (useful for detecting skimming or compromised devices).

2. Storage Layer

Landing and organizing all ingested data.

ADLS Gen2 â†’ Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned), Gold (curated) zones for both financial and conversational data.

Delta Lake â†’ Provides ACID compliance, schema evolution, and efficient querying for anomaly features.

3. Processing Layer

Where features are engineered and prepared for models.

Databricks Delta Live Tables (DLT) â†’ Real-time feature pipelines: transaction velocity, geo-distance, unusual login patterns.

Azure ML Feature Store â†’ Central registry of reusable fraud/interaction features.

Cognitive Services (Speech-to-Text) â†’ Converts voice calls from IVR or call centers into transcripts for downstream NLP-based social engineering detection.

4. Detection Layer

The brains of anomaly detection, combining different techniques.

Isolation Forest / Autoencoder â†’ Detect outliers in transaction patterns.

XGBoost / GBM models â†’ Supervised learning on labeled fraud/social engineering cases.

Graph GNN (CosmosDB + GraphFrames) â†’ Identifies hidden money mule networks or collusion between accounts.

Social Engineering NLP Classifier â†’ LLM-powered model detects conversational fraud indicators, such as:

unusual language in chats,

urgency/red flag keywords in emails,

scripted scam patterns in voice calls.

5. GenAI Layer

Where intelligence is transformed into analyst-friendly outputs.

Azure OpenAI (LLM) â†’ Interprets anomalies, explains why the event is suspicious in plain language.

Cognitive Search (RAG) â†’ Grounds the LLM with historical fraud cases, internal playbooks, and compliance policies.

Analyst Co-pilot â†’ Provides summaries, rationales, and next-best investigation steps.

6. Governance & Security

Critical to make the platform regulator-ready.

Purview â†’ End-to-end data lineage, PII classification, audit trails.

Key Vault â†’ Secrets, encryption keys, and token management.

Sentinel â†’ SIEM/SOAR integration to push critical alerts into the SOC.

Responsible AI Guardrails â†’ Fairness checks, explainability, bias monitoring on social engineering NLP models.

7. Consumption Layer

Where insights are delivered to users.

Power BI Dashboards â†’ For fraud operations and compliance reporting.

Case Management (Power Apps / GRC tools) â†’ Analysts work cases enriched with GenAI explanations.

SOC/SIEM Integration â†’ Fraud alerts routed to existing security ops workflows.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

Transactions â†’ Event Hubs

Conversations (chat/voice) â†’ APIM + Speech-to-Text â†’ NLP classifier

All data unified in Delta Lake

Models (tabular, graph, NLP) detect anomalies

GenAI explains them in plain language + suggests actions

Analysts see cases in dashboards / case mgmt tools
