Background
For the PD_UCR logic we have used the PD_ACTUAL table for now.
This is not the table from DIAL directly, but has some small logic.

Logic
Filter on Rating_status = 'ACTUAL' AND (approval date is < 24 months ago OR UCR = 6, 7 or 8)
Addition of Last performing PD model
Logic: if a rating is in default (UCR = 6, 7, or 8), then find the latest historical record with a performing rating. Pick that PD_MODEL_VERSION as last performing model
Source table: stg_{{ RUN_MONTH }}.dial_fair_pd_ucr
Target table: int_{{ RUN_MONTH }}.pd_ucr_actual

Tasks 
Create new yaml to create pd_ucr_actual from dial_fair_pd_ucr
Logic:
Add Last performing model column
  - Check if the current rating is performing (approved_ucr not 6, 7, 8)
      - If yes: take PD_Model_version from the same record
      - If not: lookup in historical records: group by Company+portfolio+businessline and sort by approval date
            - Select PD_Model_version from the most recently approved rating that is performing 
            - If multiple performing with same approval date: select PD_Model_version from the record with highest rating_id
            - If none performing: select PD_Model_version from the record with the lowest rating_id
Add filter: RATING_STATUS = 'ACTUAL' AND (PD_APPROVAL_DATE < 24 months older than Reporting date OR APPROVED_UCR in (6,7,8))
Final structure: same as DIAL PD UCR table, but with added column LastPerformingModel
