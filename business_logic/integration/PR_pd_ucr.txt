Pull Request: PD-UCR Rating Derivation Pipeline Enhancement
Summary
This PR introduces a three-step pipeline for deriving Uniform Counterparty Ratings (UCR) with enhanced default status handling and proxy rating mechanisms.
Changes Overview
1. pd_ucr_step1.yml - Base Rating Derivation

Purpose: Derives initial UCR ratings based on counterparty characteristics
Key Features:

Filters counterparties based on role flags (CollateralProvider, Guarantor, InterCompany, Issuer, ObligorNPL)
Only processes counterparties where at least one role flag = 'Y'
Integrates ratings from multiple sources in priority order:

FAIR BCDB (direct counterparty ratings)
FAIR RAPID (AAC Alpha Code based)
InterCompany (automatic '0' rating)
FAIR GBC (Global Counterparty ID based)
Sovereign ratings (for specific Basel II types)
SSF fallback (for AACF/LEASE entities)


Calculates PD (Probability of Default) with and without conservatism margins



2. pd_ucr_step2.yml - Credit Facility Linkage Enhancement

Purpose: Enhances ratings by leveraging credit facility relationships
Key Features:

Identifies counterparties needing ratings (null or expired >12 months)
Searches for valid ratings from other counterparties sharing the same credit facilities
Implements a ranking mechanism to select the most recent valid rating
Derives ratings from related counterparties when direct ratings are unavailable
Marks derived ratings with '_DERIVED' suffix in UCRCase field
Tracks the source counterparty for derived ratings



3. pd_ucr_step3.yml - Default Status Integration

Purpose: Applies default status rules and creates final UCR ratings
Key Features:

Integrates default status from default_counterparty table
Implements business rules for UniformCounterpartyRating:

Default = 'Y' with UCR 6/7/8 → Keep original rating
Default = 'Y' with UCR not 6/7/8 → Force to '6'
Default = 'N' with UCR 6/7/8 → Upgrade to '6+'
Other cases → Keep UCRStep2 or default to '6+'


Sets UCRProxyFlag to 'Y' when ratings are overridden
Adjusts PD values: Default → 1.0, Non-default proxy → 0.264
Updates rating dates for proxy ratings to reporting date



Business Impact

Improved Risk Assessment: Ensures all counterparties have appropriate ratings even when direct ratings are unavailable
Default Handling: Properly reflects default status in ratings while preserving granularity for already-distressed ratings
Audit Trail: Maintains clear tracking of rating sources and proxy applications
Compliance: Enforces business rules for counterparty ratings based on default status

Technical Details

Dependencies: Requires counterparty_scoping_local, default_counterparty, and integrated_creditfacility_links tables
Performance: Uses filtering at source level to minimize data processing
