-- Query to check why LBR join is not working
-- Replace {{ RUN_MONTH }} with actual value

-- 1. Check data types and sample values for LB_RATING_ID across tables
SELECT 
    'UCR_ACTUAL' as Table_Name,
    COUNT(*) as Total_Records,
    COUNT(LB_RATING_ID) as Non_Null_LB_RATING_ID,

-- 2. Show sample LB_RATING_IDs from both tables
SELECT 'UCR_ACTUAL Sample LB_RATING_IDs:' as Description;

-- 3. Check for exact matches
SELECT

-- 4. Check specific RatingIDs that should have LBR data
-- Based on RDF data, these should have LBR values:
