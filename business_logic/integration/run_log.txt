"I checked the data, and I see that there are still about 6000 differences (annoyingly differences where one side is null do not show up when you do <>, you need not <=> for that) where the data is filled for rdf_counterparty but not for fair_turnover. (For about 600 of these we simply filter out the rating ID already at PD UCR actual, because of the current_date being different, those can be ignored for now and later we can improve the pd actual logic to use the reporting date / month number instead of the current date to create reproducible output.)

I also see we never have any LB Rating information, whereas I can see about 550 matches between FAIR PD Actual and LB Quantative input (I am not sure how we only saw one previously). That could explain at least a part of the differences.

Please check with these queries, fix the logic to use LB data when available and look into any remaining differences:


select * from enter_202505.rdf_counterparty full join int_202505.fair_turnover
on RatingID = XPK_COUNTERPARTY
where (not TOTAL_ASSETS <=> TotalAssets)
or (not TOTAL_TURNOVER <=> AnnualTurnover); -- finds >6000 differences

select * from stg_202505.dial_fair_lbr_quantitative_input
inner join int_202505.dial_fair_pd_ucr_actual
on dial_fair_lbr_quantitative_input.LB_RATING_ID = dial_fair_pd_ucr_actual.LB_RATING_ID
where DATA_TYPE = 2; -- finds about 550 matches between FAIR PD Actual and LB Rating ID
One potential cause/fix I see is to do a how: right instead of left on line 78, so that you do not lose any PD ratings that do not have a direct rating. I think there you are currently filtering out any records that do not have any direct turnover/assets values, even though they might be able to get values via parent or LB."
