Background
As of now, we are creating 6 schemas every month like below - 
log_yyyymm
metadata_yyyymm
stg_yyyymm
int_yyyymm
enrich_yyyymm
dist_yyyymm

When we have schemas for multiple months in our catalog, we can not find all schemas created for each month at one place. Hence naming convention should be changed to find all schema related to a month can be seen easily.

So new naming convention for schema will be -
yyyymm_log
yyyymm_metadata
yyyymm_stg
yyyymm_int
yyyymm_enrich
yyyymm_dist

Tasks
Change schema names in schema creation script - </scripts/new_month_setup.py> and merge changes in main.
Manually update all schema from catalog
Update all YAMLs in main branch and push them back to main.
Inform team to incorporate same change in their feature branch
