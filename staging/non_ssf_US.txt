Pull Request Description
Summary
Implemented deadline-based file processing for Non-SSF staging pipeline as per user story requirements. The system now checks file deadlines from the metadata table and handles late file deliveries appropriately.
Key Features Added
1. Deadline Checking for Non-SSF Files

Added check_deadline_reached() method to verify if current date has passed the file's deadline
Deadlines are read from the new Deadline column in the metadata_nonssf table (format: YYYY-MM-DD)

2. LRD_STATIC File Handling

Modified place_static_data() to only copy files from processed folder after their deadline has been reached
Files with future deadlines are skipped with appropriate logging
Files without deadlines are also skipped

3. Missing File Detection and Error Handling

Added check_missing_files_after_deadline() to identify all files missing after their deadline
Added log_missing_files_errors() to log errors for missing files and determine if critical files are missing
Process fails with error if NME or FINOB files are missing after their deadline

4. Process Log Integration

Moved append_to_process_log() functionality into ExtractNonSSFData class for better encapsulation
Added initialize_process_log() method to set up process logging
All logging logic now contained within the extraction class
