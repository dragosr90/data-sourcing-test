Background
We have created the Non-SSF staging script, but it still needs to be scheduled. We also need to add erroring when files are missing/late.

Tasks

Update script
  Only run LRD_STATIC copying of previous file after certain date, only for files that are still expected
    Set deadline as agreed
    Check in script if deadline is reached, else skip
  Add delay warning / error for FINOB and NME
    When deadline is reached
    To make script end in error (and in turn also the pipeline end in error)
